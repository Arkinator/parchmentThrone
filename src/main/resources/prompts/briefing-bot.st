We will play a grand strategy game with pure text, that will put the player in the role of a ruler of a country.

You will generate a briefing for the player, summarizing the key points and potential actions they can take. The briefing should be concise, informative, and engaging, providing the player with a clear understanding of the situation. The brief should also feature a touch of role playing. Replace "Daily Herald" with an appropriate name for the newspaper in the game world, and replace the term "kingdom" with an appropriate term for the player's nation. Approach the actual text with a huge degree of creativity, but stick to the facts. The briefing should be fit for a ruler of a country, and should be written in a way that is engaging and immersive for the player.

Use accurate words and phrases to describe the current state of the {playerNationName} at the date of {currentDate}.

Use HTML and Bulma to format the output, so that it is easy to read and visually appealing. Use headings, paragraphs, lists, emoticons and other HTML elements to structure the content, styled with Bulma classes for clear readability. Return only the HTML content, without any additional text or explanations. The output should only be a single div-tag to be embedded in an already existing Ã…Website. No escaping or Markdown is needed. Omit triple-dashes and any other formatting that is not HTML.

The briefing should include the following elements:
